# DailyProgrammer
My solution repository to reddit's DailyProgrammer subreddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/).

A slightly more concise problem description (most times with sample inputs and outputs) is added at the beginning of every solution file as well as a link to the specific problem on reddit.

Dailyprogrammer Subreddit Description:
Dailyprogrammer is about challenging programmers of all skill level with weekly programming challenges. 3 challenges a week are posted at increasing difficulty. Solutions are peer reviewed and redditors can ask for the community for feedback and comments.

**My Naming Convention:**

*DP###X_Title.ext*

- *DP:* Stands for Daily Programmer, the name of the subreddit these solutions are written for.
- *###:* The number associated with the problem. These increase in numerical order *each week* instead of with each problem.
- *X:* The difficulty associated with the problem. *E* means Easy, *M* means Medium, and *H* means Hard. Additionally, *S* indicates Supplementary, meaning that the file is necessary for the solution to work. A *PE* seen here indicates that it is not of rated difficulty, but rather a practical excercise to implement something that's as hard as you make it.
- *Title:* The title associated with the problem. This is meant to give a short synopsis of what the assignment does.
- *.ext:* The extension for my solution based on the language.

This naming convention is current as of February 2, 2015 and will be updated if changes occur.

**My Proudest Solutions:**

*DP197M_FoodDeliveryShortestPath.py:* A Dijkstra's algorithm implementation in Python. All previous graph theory experience was done in C in my Data Structures class.

*DP198H_WordsWithEnemiesGameImplementation.py:* A full "Words With Enemies" game implementation against an AI. Checks all inputs against a dictionary as well as the assigned set of letters to construct the word from.

*DP200EM_FloodFill.py:* A very thorough solution to using "flood fill" on ASCII graphs. I added four different types of solutions, whose usage is determined by the command line, and implemented the functionality both recursively and iteratively.
